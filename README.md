> A curated list of Docker Stack ready to use

# Motivation

Awesome-stack follows the [awesome-compose](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose) concept but focus on `docker swarm` and `docker stack` instead of _docker-compose_.

Main goal is to have a closer **cluster concept** for DevOps, DevSecOps, SRE and other teams.

## Pre-requisites

Make sure you have docker and docker desktop installed

1. [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) - Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.

2. Docker resources

All stacks have been tested on a docker desktop with the following resources.

> In case you don't have enough resources, you can use a docker desktop with less resources.

* Once you have met all above requisites move forward to documentation section
