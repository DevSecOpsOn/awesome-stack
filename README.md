> A curated list of Docker Stack.

# Motivation

Awesome-stack follows the [awesome-compose](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose) concept but focus on `docker swarm` and `stack` instead. Main goal is to follow up a **cluster concept** for DevOps, DevSecOps and SRE teams.

## Pre-requistes

Make sure that you have docker and docker desktop installed

1. [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) - Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.

* Once you have met all the above requisites move forward to documentation section

### Documentation

### Getting started

Run below command to setup local environment with a docker swarm cluster, docker network, docker secret and deploy essential stack(s).

```sh
make all
```

For DevOps/DevSecOps/SRE tools run bellow command to deploy all stacks defined in `DEVOPS` variable.

```sh
make devops-stack
```
