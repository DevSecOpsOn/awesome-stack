> A curated list of Docker Stack ready to use

# Motivation

Awesome-stack follows the [awesome-compose](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose) concept but focus on `docker swarm` and `docker stack` instead of _docker-compose_.

Main goal is to have a closer **cluster concept** for DevOps, DevSecOps, SRE and other teams.

## Pre-requisites

Make sure you have docker and docker desktop installed

1. [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) - Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.

* Once you have met all above requisites move forward to documentation section

### Documentation

---

- [Setup](docs/setup.md) - How to setup and prepare your local environment with necessary tools
- [Deploying](docs/deploy.md) - How to deploy awesome-stacks in a simple way via `make deploy` or `make devops`
- [Encrypting](docs/age.md) - How to encrypt sensitive data e.g: passwords, tokens, secrets with age tool
